 * @defgroup structural The Structural Matrix classes
 * @brief This module contains all classes which defines Structural Matrices \n
 * Structural matrix classes make the link between the Computational meshes \ref CompMesh and the Matrix classes \ref matrix. \n
 * A structural matrix object extracts from the computational mesh the information needed to create a matrix object. \n
 * It also implements the method for assembling the matrix object
