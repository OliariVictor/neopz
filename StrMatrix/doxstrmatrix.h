 * @defgroup structural Structural Matrix classes
 * This module contains all classes which defines Structural Matrices
 * Structural matrix classes make the link between the Computational meshes \ref CompMesh and the Matrix classes \ref matrix.
 * A structural matrix object extracts from the computational mesh the information needed to create a matrix object. It also
 * implements the method for assembling the matrix object
