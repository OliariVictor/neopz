/** @defgroup interpolation Generation of an aproximation space
 * Classes which define the aproximation space combine the geometric aproximation, definition of the element, \n
 * shape functions, integration rules, and variational statement to build the element stiffness matrices \n
 * the finite elements within this tree are also responsible to generate C0 compatible interpolation spaces.
