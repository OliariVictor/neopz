/**
 * @defgroup structural Structural Matrix classes
 * This module contains all classes which defines Structural Matrices
 * Structural matrix classes make the link between the Computational meshes \ref CompMesh and the Matrix classes \ref matrix.
 * A structural matrix object extracts from the computational mesh the information needed to create a matrix object. It also
 * implements the method for assembling the matrix object
 */

/**
 * @defgroup solver Solver classes
 * This module contains all classes that represent a matrix inversion procedure. Representing a inversion procedure as an object gives the user
 * great flexibility to combine solution procedures
 */
/**
 * @defgroup frontal Frontal Matrix classes
 * This module contains all classes involved in the frontal process
